# APFM
A Project Zomboid mod for custom radios supporting weather forecasts, helicopter warnings and some random broadcast logic


The idea: screw AEBS, let's make "real" survivors predict weather and stuff, let their stories unfold and live their lives (or die, yup). Some gags, references and horsing around is welcome, but keeping it to the Zomboid lore and mood is a must. I shouldn't forget about it >_>


Features:


- [x] Randomized broadcasts for different stage of the game
- [x] Weather forecasts
- [x] Heli warnings
- [x] Random events instead of broadcasts - NEED TEXTS
- [x] Random people getting into the air - NEED TEXTS
- [] 4 radiostations - NEED TEXTS AND STRUCTURE
- [] Storytelling - NEED A SCRIPT GUY, FILMING CREW AND SOMEONE WHERE IS MY GODDAMN COFFEE?
- [] Channel death mechanics? Anything can happen in the apocalypse, including your DJ dying
- [] Complex visual novel-style storytelling? I want to turn my mod into an audiovisual novel! (or not, sounds scary)


There are 4 stations planned:


## Hermit station:


Broadcasts weather, good vibes and songs. Gives lessons about survival stuff


Host: Joshua: a guy in 60s, ex hippie, worked as weather technician. Has skills and tools to give some approximate weather forecast for a day ahead. Lost his wife in the outbreak. Scared of zombies, so he lives in a shack somewhere off-grid. Soft, poetic, plays guitar, talks about spiritual stuff and nature, tries to send good vibes in the air.


This is the first station to implement, just to see how it goes. Not much progression here, but the old man gets lonley and becomes more sad by the end game, starts mention his wife and stuff briefly.


## Gunmen station (working name)


Broadcasts helicopter warnings, weapon-related lessons and some urban-focused survival


Host 1, Caleb: an ex-military, about 40, after Gulf war was working as a shooting range instructor in Knox county. He's an asshole, a bit racist, has rather redneck vibes and sharp tongue. However, he does care about people around him and doesn't want his listeners to die, so he helps them as he can: gives advice on how to approach guns, encorages to be brave and plays rock tapes to lift the spirit.


Host 2, Tylor: an ex colledge student in his late teens - early 20. Good at sports (baseball player), rather open-minded and wit. Had rather rough childhood living with only father and being black kid in rural Kentucky. Has been rescued by Caleb and stick with him. Really mischievous guy. Gives meele weapon lessons, maybe some physical-related advice. TODO: he sounds like a too nice guy. Joshua is a coward, Caleb is an asshole. What's the deal with Tylor?


They have kind of soft conflict with between them: I want them to have some fights in the beginning, but getting used to each other and becoming close friends as time passes.


## Survivor group


Dunno what useful to put in there. Just chatter from raids to make world feel more alive? Would be amazing if I could attach their stories to barricaded houses on the map, like "hey, I saw a barricaded house south of West Point, we need to check it sometime". As for progression - great potential, probably a love story, fights with paramilitary guys? I dunno, didn't think much about these guys


## Paramilitary group


Some wannabe military (or real military?) using frequency beyond civilian radio.


These assholes send choppers (if enabled more than once in sandbox): asking for exfil of request of moving the zombies from operation zone from them is a sign that a chopper is coming. Need to think trough why are they doing this, but they ARE hostile and have fights with the survivor group. Potential for story line as well.
